 * Match Auto 1: waits for the alliance partner to shoot, then shoots its 4 balls from the starting pose with the same
 * aim-and-shoot as the TeleOp's aim trigger (see aimAndShootCommand()), then pulls away from the wall and strafes
 * into the parking square. The start heading already faces the cell, so aiming barely turns it (90 deg on red, 270 deg on blue). Each
 * drive leg finishes only once the robot is at its target pose (see Drivetrain's followPathCommand()).
 * Not listed on the Driver Station itself: RedMatchAuto1 and BlueMatchAuto1 choose the alliance.
