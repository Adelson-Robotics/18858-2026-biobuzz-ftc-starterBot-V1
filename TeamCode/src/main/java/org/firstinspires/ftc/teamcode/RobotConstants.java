 * Definitions only, no logic: the constants that more than one class reads. Two sections: the gamepad button
 * mapping (read by Robot and the TeleOp), and the few tunables shared between classes.
 * A constant that only one class uses lives at the top of that class instead (hardware names, tuning gains, and
 * so on), so it sits next to the code it tunes. Pedro's own tuned values (PIDs, pod offsets, drivetrain motor
 * names, etc.) stay in subsystems/drivetrain/pedro/Constants.java.
 * All positions are Pedro field coordinates: x and y in inches, heading in degrees (counterclockwise is positive).
