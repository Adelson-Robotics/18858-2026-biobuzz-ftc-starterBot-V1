/**
 * Distance -> shooter RPM lookup, with linear interpolation between rows. Pure Java, no hardware.
 * Distances below the first row or above the last row get that end row's RPM; the table never extrapolates.
 * Whether a distance is close/far enough to shoot from at all is a separate range (inRange()), which can be
 * narrower than the table: the table's rows exist for interpolation, the range is where shots actually work.
 * To add a row, add it to SHOT_TABLE_DISTANCES_INCHES / SHOT_TABLE_RPMS (keep distances ascending).
 *
 * The curve is deliberately U-shaped: close in, the shot needs more speed to clear the front lip of the CELL.
 * Don't smooth it into a line.
 *
 * Raw measurements behind the table, all against the measured cell (ShotTarget.BLUE_LOWER). Positions are in the
 * old TeleOp frame (Pedro minus 8.5 in on x and y): inches, heading in degrees, 0 = +x, CCW positive.
 * RPMs are shooter motor RPM as shown on telemetry (28 ticks/rev). Keep these for future tuning.
